--First I created a store database

CREATE TABLE swimwear (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price INTEGER, color TEXT, style TEXT, quantity INTEGER);

INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (1, "hannah top", 20, "yellow", "two piece", 5);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (2, "marley one piece", 50, "orange", "one piece", 10);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (3, "dallas top", 15, "red", "two piece", 5);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (4, "sonny bottoms", 15, "red", "two piece", 5);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (6, "Marley top", 18, "blue", "two piece", 7);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (7, "ranger bottoms", 18, "blue", "two piece", 7);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (8, "poppi one piece", 45, "pink", "one piece", 10);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (9, "fredy bottoms", 16, "black", "two piece", 11);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (10, "birdie one piece", 80, "black", "one piece", 20);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (11, "tessa skirt", 10, "white", " cover up", 30);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (12, "isla skirt", 10, "white", "cover up", 20);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (13, "brooke one piece", 50, "white", "one piece", 10);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (14, "kira top", 16, "black", "two piece", 10);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (15, "roxy bottoms", 16, "black", "two piece", 10);
INSERT INTO swimwear VALUES (16, "natalie top", 16, "black", "two piece", 10);

--Then I displayed the database ordered by price.

SELECT * FROM swimwear ORDER BY price ASC;

--Then I displayed the total sum of the inventory.

SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM swimwear;

--Then I displayed the max amount that there is of one item.

SELECT MAX(quantity) FROM swimwear;

--Lastly, I displayed the name and price of each item ordered by the price descending. 

SELECT name, price FROM swimwear ORDER BY price DESC;
